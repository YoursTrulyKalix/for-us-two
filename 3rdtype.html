    <h1>All through it</h1>

    <p>The first time I saw you, I was mesmerized <br>
        That's why I couldn't believe it with my eyes <br>
        That the beautiful woman I saw before me <br>
        It was clearly that I fell for you quickly <br>

        <br>

        As I entered the classroom <br> 
        The first thing I saw was you <br>
        You were smiling in there <br>
        Looking beautifully as you do <br>

        <br>
        
        As I found out about something <br>
        My world crumbled into nothing <br>
        Is it my fate? <br>
        Or am I just always late from starting? <br>

        <br>
        
        I never thought It could break me apart <br>
        But it never hold me down from the start <br>
        I just wish to be close with you <br>
        Like the things that lovers do <br>
    </p>
